# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I have created a responsive website dedicated to showcasing my portfolio. I created this website by following the instructions below and from the CSS and HTML that I have learned in the last week. 

Files included:
index.html
about.html
portfolio.html
contact.html
index.css
README.md

My contact page was influenced by Pro Web @ youtube.com and using bootstrap layouts, but I made it my own. Everything else, I built from scratch using bootstrap. 

I do not have any projects to showcase currently, so all of the links attached on my portfolio page are not to any of my work. 

By clicking "Brandon Clark" in the nav bar, you will be taken back to the home page.
